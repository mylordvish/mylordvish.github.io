        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey guys! I am Sravya, a 90% cute and a 10% fiery girl, who actually hails from Andhra but currently lives in US. If you are visiting this website, you are either me or someone who is a big fan of mine. Either way, I am glad and I welcome you to this awesome site. I say awesome because it just has some awesome pics of mine *Wink*. Anyway, to say more about me, I like shopping, the colour black, deep fried chicken, big bangles, dark chocalates, traveling, guys with beard and weird hairstyles, shopping again, long bike rides, actor Sethupathi, beaches, 3.30-train-to-my-hometown, Chris Hemsworth, Prawns, Despacito song, cooking, a bit of adventure, creating crafts, brownie with icecream, making others happy and then... Yeah. I've pretty much covered, I guess. Oh, wait. I forgot! I also like annoying Vishvesh in a sweet way :) Poor Guy!! 
            Anyway, feel free to scroll down to know more about me.

                        So, wondering what this is all about? I understand the confusion. <br>
                        For the past years, whenever your birthday was around, I did not have to think much and somehow managed to present you something which made you happy (he he. Okay. At least a bit? No? Okay.) <br>
                        But this year was different. <br>
                        I wanted to write something, which you have been asking for a quite long time, but I did not want to just write something and give you. I had already done that a lot, I suppose. So, I decided to do something more, something which would really suprise you and put a genuine smile on your beautiful face. I had put in a lot of effort just to decide on what to give on you birthday which would be really worthy. For the most amount of time, I could not get anything on my head and I hit myself, I punched myself and at last this is what I could come up with. <br>
                        Yes! A webite. A website just for you and only for you. A webite which I developed. A website of YOU! That's it! Nothing more. This is my intention. I hope you liked it. If not, I am so sorry to disappoint you. <br>
                        So, yeah, with this webite, here's Vishvesh, your bestie, your beloved or your worst nightmare, I don't know, whatever, wishing the most beuatiful girl, a wonderful B'day! Just be happy. Things are going to be awesome for you. Enjoy and cheers! <br>
                        We'll enhance this website up later, if at all you need it in the future, okay?
